## Group Members
Devonald Manney - One of my strengths is that I have a great sensitivity of user-system interactions. This can positively effect the designing phase of development. I'm also a natural born problem solver.

Vincent Huang - One of my strengths that I have is I have really creative sense of ideas. I can come up with weird, and bizarre ideas for a webpage randomly. This can help out if there are still things that the group might want to add to the project.

Matthew Hofmann - One of my strengths is that I am a strong communicator. This can help in our project not only when discussing and brainstorming on what to work on, but also when making commits and version control.
